<p> Today’s tale is about:</p>
<p>  *** The Letter from the lawyer  ***</p>
</p>
    <br />

<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I bring tidings of great import from the realm of property law. The esteemed clients of Van der Zwan Vastgoed B.V. and Kijberg beheer B.V. (hereinafter referred to as "the mighty clients") have entrusted me with a most</p> 
<p>pressing matter. It appears that a certain individual, hereinafter dubbed "the stubborn owner," has refused to cooperate in the amendment of a deed of division pertaining to their property.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait! Surely this is a matter for the courts, not some fanciful tale of legal magic?" Ah, but my dear reader, you would be mistaken. For in the realm of property law, such disputes are often settled through the art of negotiation and the craft of compromise.</p>

<p>And so, I find myself tasked with the duty of persuading the stubborn owner to see reason and bend to the will of the mighty clients. But fear not, dear reader, for I shall not resort to the use of force or coercion. Nay, I shall employ a far more subtle and cunning strategy: the power of words!</p>

<p>You see, the deed of division in question contains a most curious clause, one that grants the mighty clients the authority to make certain changes to the property, including the creation of an entrance on the third floor and the installation of a partition. 'Tis a gift, if you will, from the original drafters of the deed, a sort of Easter egg hidden within the text.</p>

<p>Now, I know that the stubborn owner may argue that such changes would be detrimental to their own property, but fear not! For the mighty clients have graciously offered to bear the full cost of these alterations, leaving naught but goodwill and improved relations in their wake.</p>

<p>But alas, the stubborn owner refuses to budge, like a mule with its head stuck in a fedora. And so, I am compelled to issue this formal notice, a veritable ultimatum if you will: the mighty clients demand that the stubborn owner cooperate in the amendment of the deed of division, or face the consequences of their 
obstinacy.</p>

<p>So, noble reader, I implore thee: let this be a lesson to all who would dare challenge the might of my mighty clients. Heed their demands, or suffer the wrath of their legal might!</p>

<p>And so, I conclude with these final words of wisdom: in the realm of property law, the pen is mightier than the sword. May the might of the mighty clients be an example to us all, and may the stubborn owner soon learn the folly of their ways.</p>

<p>Fare thee well, noble reader! May the courts of justice be ever in your favor.’</p>
   <br />
                                                                       <p> Signed: The Respectable Dakterras Lawyer</p>

<h1>Dakterras VvE</h1>
  <br />
<p> Today’s tale is about:</p>
<p>  *** The Neighbour: a big company, with deep pockets and a team of skilled lawyers ***</p>
<p>  *** The Dakterras ***
</p>
    <br />

<p>Ah, the nefarious neighbor! The one who doth seek to pillage and plunder the very fabric of our building's community! But fear not, for we shall not be intimidated by their deep pockets and legion of hungry lawyers. Nay, we shall rise up and fight this Goliath with the power of justice and the might of our own legal might! </p>

<p> Behold, our neighbor, a behemoth of a company with coffers overflowing with gold and an army of ruthless attorneys at their beck and call. Their business model, you ask? Why, it is as simple as it is diabolical: they seek to buy the attic of a building and claim the roof as their own, all while leaving the rest of us to continue paying for part of the roof's maintenance! Can you imagine such audacity?</p>

<p> But fear not, dear friends, for we shall not be taken in by their cunning schemes. Nay, we shall don our finest legal garb and charge forth into battle, our swords of justice shining brightly in the light of truth. Forsooth, we shall present a legal portrait of such beauty and grace that it shall make the angels weep with envy!</p>

<p> Behold, our legal portret of this wicked neighbor:</p>

<p> Name: The Great and Terrible Neighbor (GATN)</p>

<p> Age: Old enough to know better, but too greedy to care</p>

<p> Occupation: Purveyor of fine roof terraces, at the expense of others</p>

<p> Residence: The attic of our building, with plans to expand into the rest of the structure </p>

<p> Special Skills: Legal gymnastics and the art of profiteering </p>

<p> Weaknesses: A weakness in the law, a lack of empathy, and an insatiable hunger for gold </p>

<p> Now then, dear readers, let us proceed to the heart of the matter. GATN's business model is as follows: they shall buy the attic of our building for a song, and then, with the help of their army of lawyers, they shall claim the roof as their own private terrace! Can you imagine such gall? </p>

<p> But fear not, dear friends, for we shall not be swayed by their empty promises and hollow threats. Nay, we shall stand strong and united, our voices raised in righteous indignation, and we shall fight this Goliath with every weapon at our disposal! Forsooth, we shall multiply our initial investment fivefold (at least), and we shall do it all without sacrificing the safety and well-being of our beloved building. </p>

<p> So let us march forth into battle, dear readers, with our heads held high and our hearts full of courage. For we are the owners of this fair building, and we shall not be defeated by the machinations of a wicked neighbor! Together, we shall vanquish GATN and emerge victorious, our legal portret shining brightly in the light of justice!</p>

<h1>Wijziging Splitsingsakte VvE</h1>
  <br />
<p> Today’s tale is about:</p>
<p>  *** The Neighbour: a big company, with deep pockets and a team of skilled lawyers ***</p>
<p>  *** The arrival of the Concept Wijziging Splitsingsakte ***
</p>
    <br />
<p>  Three years ago, we received a letter from our neighbor's notary that would change everything. It was like receiving a rare and mysterious invitation 
  to a secret world, one that we never knew existed right next door. The letter announced the arrival of a Concept Wijziging Splitsingsakte, a document 
  that would divide our shared property line and create a new Deed of Division.</p>
<p>  At first, we were confused and even skeptical. Why would our neighbor want to split again our land? What hidden secrets lay within this mysterious document?
But as we delved deeper into the world of property law, we discovered a realm of intricate rules and regulations that governed the boundaries between our properties.</p>
<p>  We learned about the importance of the Changing of the Deed of Division, a process that would alter the way our land was divided and potentially change the fate
  of our neighborhood. It was like uncovering a hidden treasure map, one that led us on a journey through the labyrinthine world of property law.</p>
<p>  As we navigated this new landscape, we discovered that our neighbor was not just any ordinary neighbor. They were a big company, with deep pockets and a team
  of skilled lawyers who had been waiting for this moment for years. It was like facing a powerful dragon, one that had been sleeping beneath our feet for centuries, 
  waiting to be awakened by the call of the Splitsingsakte.</p>
<p>  And so, dear reader, for now let this be a lesson to you. In the world of property law, nothing is as it seems. There are hidden secrets and mysterious documents
  waiting to be uncovered, and only those who are brave enough to venture into this realm will emerge victorious. So, go forth and explore the labyrinthine world of 
  property law, for within its depths lies a treasure beyond your wildest dreams.</p>
<p>  Three years have passed since that fateful notary email, and yet, the battle for our land rages on. We refused to be intimidated by the forces of darkness, 
  standing firm in our quest for justice. The intricacies of property law became our weapon of choice, as we mastered the art of Deed of Division with a determination
  that would make even the most skilled attorneys quiver. But despite our valiant efforts, the outcome remains 
uncertain. Will we emerge victorious, or will the shadows claim our land forever? The fate of our property hangs in the balance, as we await the final showdown that 
  will decide the course of our future. Will you join us on this epic journey, and discover the shocking twists and turns that lie ahead?</p>

<h1>A Game of Homes: The Unknown Dangers of Buying an Apartment in Amsterdam</h1>
    <br />
<p>Welcome to the world of Dutch real estate, where the rules are as complex as a George R.R. Martin novel and the stakes are higher than any Game of Thrones battle. 
  I'm here to guide you through the treacherous landscape of buying an apartment in Amsterdam. 
Buckle up, because this is going to be a wild ride!</p>
<p>Our story begins on June 2014, when we bravely (or foolishly) decided to purchase an apartment in the heart of Amsterdam. We were swept away by the charm of the 
  city's canals, the beauty of the Rijksmuseum, and the promise of endless stroopwafels. Little did we know that this decision would lead us down a path filled with 
  unknown dangers, legal quagmires, and more twists and turns than a Tolkien novel.
</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics: what is a VvE? Well, my friends, a VvE (Vereniging van Eigenaren) is a legal entity that manages the common areas of an apartment 
  complex. Think of it like a medieval lordship, where the VvE is the all-powerful ruler of the land, and you are just a humble peasant. But wait, there's more! 
  In Amsterdam, the VvE also has the power to levy fees and fines on its subjects, I mean, residents. So, if you 
thought you were just buying an apartment, think again. You're also getting a heaping helping of bureaucracy and legalese.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about our neighbors. Ah, the neighbors! In our case, they are like the Wildlings at the Wall: unpredictable, mysterious, and sometimes dangerous.
  When you buy an apartment, you become part of a close-knit community, bound together by the shared walls of your building. But beware, my friends, for in this world 
  of condominium living, your neighbors can also be your greatest enemies. They may seem friendly now, but just wait until they start complaining about the noise you
  make while walking on your hardwood floors (yes, it's a thing).
</p>
<p>But fear not, dear reader, for we have a secret weapon against these unknown dangers: the Splitsingsake! This mysterious document is like a magical map that
  reveals the hidden dangers and pitfalls of Amsterdam's real estate market. It's a bit like Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, but instead of breathing fire, it 
  breathes legalese. With the Splitsingsake in hand, you can navigate the treacherous waters of Dutch property law and emerge victorious.
</p>
<p>So, there you have it: a Game of Homes, where the stakes are high, the dangers are lurking around every corner, but with the right tools and knowledge, 
  you can conquer the real estate market in Amsterdam. Just remember, when buying an apartment, don't be like Jon Snow and ignore the advice of the wise people. 
  Read those legal documents, ask questions, and above all, beware the neighbors!
